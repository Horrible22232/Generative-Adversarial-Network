# Generative-Adversarial-Network

On progress

# Introduction
In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) became a widely known and important subfield of Machine Learning for generating images. GANs are unsupervised learning algorithms, so unlabled data in form of images is needed in order to generate new, unseen images from a data distribution.

# Details
A Generative Adversarial Network consists of two parts, namely the generator and predictor. The predictor is trained to determine if a sample is generated or real data. On the other hand, the generator tries to fool the discriminator by generating images, which are similar to the real data. 
In the course of training, the generator gets better in generating and discriminator in identifying the generated images. All in all, GANs are a powerfull methode to approximate a data distribution.
